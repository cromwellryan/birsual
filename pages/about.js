      <h1>About Birsual.com</h1>
      <p>"Bir Sual" means "question" in Azerbaijani. Birsual.com arose from 
        collecting interesting questions and conversation starters for 
        one-on-one meetings that Ryan Cromwell has with team members.</p>

      <p>Credit to <a href="https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/">Jason Evanish</a> for so many wonderful questions, without which Ryan's one-on-one's would not have been nearly as valuable.</p>

      <p>Shout out to the Sassmaster, <a href="https://zastrow.co/">Philip Zastrow</a>, for kindly lending his amazing design skills to Birsual.com.</p>
