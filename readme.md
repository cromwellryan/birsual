# 1 Question

## Getting Started

1. Clone it
2. Use `node` >=10.13
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:3000


## Where things are

This is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org) project (aka React). Pages are `js`
files under the `/pages` folder while some shared stuff is under `/components`.

There is a single css file at `static/styles.css`. Feel free to dump everything
in there.

🗒️ Note: All pages and components will hot reload. I don't believe that is true
of `styles.css`. YMMV
